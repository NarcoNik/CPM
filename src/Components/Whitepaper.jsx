                <br />
                Hidden in the slums of the immense Night City Superpolis lies a
                valuable and super rare resource -{" "}
                <span style={{ color: "#02ffff" }}> $NEON </span>. Humans from
                all Superpolis outskirts flock to it hoping to get some of its
                supplies, but dissenters lurk in the dark alleys ready to steal
                all the mined wealth. Cyborgs are neutral in this confrontation
                and provide support to both sides.
                <br />
                <br />
                Among Night City residents, everyone will find{" "}
                <span style={{ color: "#02ffff" }}> $NEON </span> highly
                essential.
                <br />
                <br />
                The problem is, the humans were not the only ones that were
                interested in these fabulous alleys full of{" "}
                <span style={{ color: "#02ffff" }}> $NEON </span>. Some
                malicious people went to the city, who will try to kidnap the
                humans.. They're called Implants. <br />
                <br />
                Although the common reputation of Implants is that they are
                psychopaths who want to kidnap poor humans, their real
                intentions are actually to steal as much{" "}
                <span style={{ color: "#02ffff" }}> $NEON </span> as possible
                and recruit humans to their ranks. Even their ability 'Hacking'
                is designed to empty pockets of everyone else.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Implants usually keep watching for the city edges. As long
                as you keep searching for{" "}
                <span style={{ color: "#02ffff" }}> $NEON </span> it should be
                fine, but if you try to escape ( harvest ) or enter the city (
                mint ) there is a chance an Implant find you and kidnap you, be
                careful.
                <br />
                Whatever will happen, one thing is certain, whether it is Human,
                Implant, or Cyborg, everyone is going to become rich thanks to
                the incredible value of{" "}
                <span style={{ color: "#02ffff" }}> $NEON </span> on the black
                market (tethys link). Let's begin the CYBER PUNK METIS!
